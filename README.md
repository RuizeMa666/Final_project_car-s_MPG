# Final_project_car-s_MPG

The data is in the data/ document with a description in it. 

The python version and package used is in the environment.yml/ file. 

I have saved the best models in different splitting for each model used. They are in the results/ document. 
The scores for each model is the results/all_scores/, a summary of scores is in results/scores_summary/.

The code is in a jupyter notebook called Auto_mpg in the src/ document.
